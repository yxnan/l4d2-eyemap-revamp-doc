## Brief

This campaign map is originally from the game *E.Y.E Divine Cybermancy*, which released on 30 Jul, 2011 and shared the same engine as *Left 4 Dead 2*.

It was later ported to L4D2 by MLUI in around June 2019 (based on the last modified time of the map source files), and since then it hit the L4D2 community with its outstanding art style comparing to other custom maps, and still remains relevant till today.

However, despite the popularity, this port is not perfect. The original maps were designed for a completely different game as L4D2, both in storyline and gameplay. Thus, a simple decompile-n-recompile process will not work well on it. And the porter, MLUI, seemed not to spend much time on it, so it resulted in a half-baked port that didn't fit right in the L4D2 box. Sometimes a button is added without further elaboration, which makes players confused; sometimes it seems there are multiple promising routes but they don't always lead to the saferoom, which is a big faux pas for a L4D2 campaign and it makes players mentally exhausted; sometimes the level transition looks arbitrary and doesn't connect with the previous level, and so on. Those countless issues are a shame for such an extraordinary map.

## Goal

We love this map, and at the same time are haunted by the flaws in it. This is why we decided to revamp this port, making it feels more polished and less painful to play.

Overall, these are the goals that we will bear in mind all the time when working on the map:

1. **Playtime**. A huge map with 12 levels is way insane, hopefully we can reduce it down to 6 levels and make it finishable within 2 hours, or even 1.5 hours.
2. **Routes**. L4D2 is not an open-world game, and too many explorable areas are a burden to players. The routes need to be altered and redesigned to be more linear, as in all of the L4D2 official campaigns.
3. **Transitions**. The inter-level parts need to be cleverly connected.
4. **Story**. A clear and continuous story is a bonus point for a custom campaign. The storytelling will be done through the ambient details, such as graffiti, bloodshed, and deserted equipment.
5. **Music**. In the MLUI's port, Sometimes ambient pops out all of sudden and feels out of place. We need to select some other appropriate music for the job. Also, all of the music from the port won't play on the Linux version of the game, and I spend most of my time on Linux, so this is the issue I personally want to resolve.
